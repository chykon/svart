# Svart

## WARNING

**The project is at an early stage of development. Here you will not find any high-quality documentation, or full testing, or an excess of functionality. However, it may be sufficient for some use cases.**

## SystemVerilog + Dart = Svart

Svart is an embedded (in Dart) domain-specific language for describing binary circuits, generating a strict subset of SystemVerilog and easily interacting with external tools.

## Usage

See [examples](example)

## Contributing

**Please note that at the moment the project does not accept all types of contributions.** Code merge requests are not accepted as the architecture is not well established and the code may be subject to large changes. Any suggestions or positive/negative comments in any form (`issues`/`discussions`) are accepted.
